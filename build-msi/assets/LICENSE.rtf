\par
The source code of this product is available under free and open-source licenses.\par
\par
More specifically, most of the source code is available under the Apache License 2.0.\par
Only code that is directly included into the product IDEasy is part of what you download as our product and therefore considered as derivative work.\par
Such code included in this product is either also unter Apache License 2.0 or another free and open-source licenses that is listed below.\par
\par
However, our product allows to install and run other software.\par
All of this is optional and can be configured as needed.\par
Since such software is executed as a seperated process and is fully optional, it is not to be considered as derivative work.\par
Without IDEasy you just install such software manually and the only difference is that we automate this for you.\par
However, due to automation you may not explicitly decide and notice what the license of such software is.\par
Therefore, we list such software with their licenses explicitly below esp. those that require reproduction of the license text in the distribution.\par
Before using our product and installig additional software with it you need to agree to such licenses and be aware of this.\par
\par
NOTE: Please be aware that it is even possible to configure and automatically install some commercial software that is NOT open-source and requires a license to be used (e.g. IntelliJ ultimate edition).\par
Hence, only configure and use such software if you have an according license.\par
\par
The following table shows the components that may be used.\par
The column `inclusion` indicates the way the component is included:\par
\par
* `directly included` means the component is directly contained in the download package of `IDEasy` we provide (derivative work)\par
* `default setup` means the component is not initially included but will be downloaded during creation of a link:project.adoc[`project`] by default\par

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or\par
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a\par
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work\par
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).\par
\par
      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object\par
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the\par
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications\par
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes\par
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain\par
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,\par
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.\par
\par
      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including\par
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions\par

      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,\par
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,\par

      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their\par
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)\par
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You\par
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a\par
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work\par
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct\par
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses\par
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate\par
      as of the date such litigation is filed.\par
\par
   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\par
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\par
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\par
      meet the following conditions:\par
\par
      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\par
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\par
\par
      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\par
          stating that You changed the files; and\par
\par
      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\par
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\par
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\par
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\par
          the Derivative Works; and\par
\par
      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its\par
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\par
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\par
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\par
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\par
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\par
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\par
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\par
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\par
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\par
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\par
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\par
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\par
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\par
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\par
          as modifying the License.\par
\par
      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\par
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\par
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\par
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\par
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\par
      the conditions stated in this License.\par
\par
   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\par
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\par
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\par
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\par
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\par
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\par
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\par
\par
   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\par
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\par
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\par
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\par
\par
   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\par
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\par
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,\par
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\par
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\par
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\par
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\par
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\par
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\par
\par
   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\par
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\par
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\par
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\par
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\par
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\par
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\par
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\par
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\par
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\par
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\par
\par
   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\par
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\par
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\par
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\par
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\par
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\par
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\par
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\par
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\par
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\par

\par
i) changes to the Program, and\par
\par
ii) additions to the Program;\par
\par
where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.\par
\par
"Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.\par
\par
"Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when combined with the Program.\par
\par
"Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement.\par
\par
"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, including all Contributors.\par
\par
2. GRANT OF RIGHTS\par
\par
a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.\par
\par
b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.\par
\par
c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program.\par
\par
d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.\par
\par
3. REQUIREMENTS\par
\par
A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its own license agreement, provided that:\par
\par
a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and\par
\par
b) its license agreement:\par
\par
i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;\par
\par
ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;\par
\par
iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and\par
\par
iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.\par
\par
When the Program is made available in source code form:\par
\par
a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and\par
\par
b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.\par
\par
Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the Program.\par
\par
Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.\par
\par
4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION\par
\par
Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.\par
\par
For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.\par
\par
5. NO WARRANTY\par
\par
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement , including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.\par
\par
6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY\par
\par
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\par
\par
7. GENERAL\par
\par
If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\par
\par
If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.\par
\par
All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.\par
\par
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.\par
\par
This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.\par

Preamble\par
\par
This license establishes the terms under which a given free software Package may be copied, modified, distributed, and/or redistributed. The intent is that the Copyright Holder maintains some artistic control over the development of that Package while still keeping the Package available as open source and free software.\par
\par
You are always permitted to make arrangements wholly outside of this license directly with the Copyright Holder of a given Package. If the terms of this license do not permit the full use that you propose to make of the Package, you should contact the Copyright Holder and seek a different licensing arrangement.\par
Definitions\par
\par
"Copyright Holder" means the individual(s) or organization(s) named in the copyright notice for the entire Package.\par
\par
"Contributor" means any party that has contributed code or other material to the Package, in accordance with the Copyright Holder's procedures.\par
\par
"You" and "your" means any person who would like to copy, distribute, or modify the Package.\par
\par
"Package" means the collection of files distributed by the Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection and/or of those files. A given Package may consist of either the Standard Version, or a Modified Version.\par
\par
"Distribute" means providing a copy of the Package or making it accessible to anyone else, or in the case of a company or organization, to others outside of your company or organization.\par
\par
"Distributor Fee" means any fee that you charge for Distributing this Package or providing support for this Package to another party. It does not mean licensing fees.\par
\par
"Standard Version" refers to the Package if it has not been modified, or has been modified only in ways explicitly requested by the Copyright Holder.\par
\par
"Modified Version" means the Package, if it has been changed, and such changes were not explicitly requested by the Copyright Holder.\par
\par
"Original License" means this Artistic License as Distributed with the Standard Version of the Package, in its current version or as it may be modified by The Perl Foundation in the future.\par
\par
"Source" form means the source code, documentation source, and configuration files for the Package.\par
\par
"Compiled" form means the compiled bytecode, object code, binary, or any other form resulting from mechanical transformation or translation of the Source form.\par
Permission for Use and Modification Without Distribution\par
\par
(1) You are permitted to use the Standard Version and create and use Modified Versions for any purpose without restriction, provided that you do not Distribute the Modified Version.\par
Permissions for Redistribution of the Standard Version\par
\par
(2) You may Distribute verbatim copies of the Source form of the Standard Version of this Package in any medium without restriction, either gratis or for a Distributor Fee, provided that you duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers. At your discretion, such verbatim copies may or may not include a Compiled form of the Package.\par
\par
(3) You may apply any bug fixes, portability changes, and other modifications made available from the Copyright Holder. The resulting Package will still be considered the Standard Version, and as such will be subject to the Original License.\par
Distribution of Modified Versions of the Package as Source\par
\par
(4) You may Distribute your Modified Version as Source (either gratis or for a Distributor Fee, and with or without a Compiled form of the Modified Version) provided that you clearly document how it differs from the Standard Version, including, but not limited to, documenting any non-standard features, executables, or modules, and provided that you do at least ONE of the following:\par
\par
(a) make the Modified Version available to the Copyright Holder of the Standard Version, under the Original License, so that the Copyright Holder may include your modifications in the Standard Version.\par
(b) ensure that installation of your Modified Version does not prevent the user installing or running the Standard Version. In addition, the Modified Version must bear a name that is different from the name of the Standard Version.\par
(c) allow anyone who receives a copy of the Modified Version to make the Source form of the Modified Version available to others under\par
(i) the Original License or\par
(ii) a license that permits the licensee to freely copy, modify and redistribute the Modified Version using the same licensing terms that apply to the copy that the licensee received, and requires that the Source form of the Modified Version, and of any works derived from it, be made freely available in that license fees are prohibited but Distributor Fees are allowed.\par
Distribution of Compiled Forms of the Standard Version or Modified Versions without the Source\par
\par
(5) You may Distribute Compiled forms of the Standard Version without the Source, provided that you include complete instructions on how to get the Source of the Standard Version. Such instructions must be valid at the time of your distribution. If these instructions, at any time while you are carrying out such distribution, become invalid, you must provide new instructions on demand or cease further distribution. If you provide valid instructions or cease distribution within thirty days after you become aware that the instructions are invalid, then you do not forfeit any of your rights under this license.\par
\par
(6) You may Distribute a Modified Version in Compiled form without the Source, provided that you comply with Section 4 with respect to the Source of the Modified Version.\par
Aggregating or Linking the Package\par
\par
(7) You may aggregate the Package (either the Standard Version or Modified Version) with other packages and Distribute the resulting aggregation provided that you do not charge a licensing fee for the Package. Distributor Fees are permitted, and licensing fees for other components in the aggregation are permitted. The terms of this license apply to the use and Distribution of the Standard or Modified Versions as included in the aggregation.\par
\par
(8) You are permitted to link Modified and Standard Versions with other works, to embed the Package in a larger work of your own, or to build stand-alone binary or bytecode versions of applications that include the Package, and Distribute the result without restriction, provided the result does not expose a direct interface to the Package.\par
Items That are Not Considered Part of a Modified Version\par
\par
(9) Works (including, but not limited to, modules and scripts) that merely extend or make use of the Package, do not, by themselves, cause the Package to be a Modified Version. In addition, such works are not considered parts of the Package itself, and are not subject to the terms of this license.\par
General Provisions\par
\par
(10) Any use, modification, and distribution of the Standard or Modified Versions is governed by this Artistic License. By using, modifying or distributing the Package, you accept this license. Do not use, modify, or distribute the Package, if you do not accept this license.\par
\par
(11) If your Modified Version has been derived from a Modified Version made by someone other than you, you are nevertheless required to ensure that your Modified Version complies with the requirements of this license.\par
\par
(12) This license does not grant you the right to use any trademark, service mark, tradename, or logo of the Copyright Holder.\par
\par
(13) This license includes the non-exclusive, worldwide, free-of-charge patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import and otherwise transfer the Package with respect to any patent claims licensable by the Copyright Holder that are necessarily infringed by the Package. If you institute patent litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim) against any party alleging that the Package constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then this Artistic License to you shall terminate on the date that such litigation is filed.\par
\par
(14) Disclaimer of Warranty: THE PACKAGE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER AND CONTRIBUTORS "AS IS' AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES.

    Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database, or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public License.\par
    Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.\par
    Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights under this Public License.\par
    Share means to provide material to the public by any means or process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution, dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material available to the public including in ways that members of the public may access the material from a place and at a time individually chosen by them.\par
    Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially equivalent rights anywhere in the world.\par
    You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.\par
\par
Section 2 \endash  Scope.\par
\par
    License grant.\par
        Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:\par
            reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part; and\par
            produce and reproduce, but not Share, Adapted Material.\par
        Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with its terms and conditions.\par
        Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section 6(a).\par
        Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created, and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or authority to forbid You from making technical modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)(4) never produces Adapted Material.\par
        Downstream recipients.\par
            Offer from the Licensor \endash  Licensed Material. Every recipient of the Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this Public License.\par
            No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed Material.\par
        No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by, the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).\par
\par
    Other rights.\par
        Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise.\par
        Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License.\par
        To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly reserves any right to collect such royalties.\par
\par
Section 3 \endash  License Conditions.\par
\par
Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the following conditions.\par
\par
    Attribution.\par
\par
        If You Share the Licensed Material, You must:\par
            retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with the Licensed Material:\par
                identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and any others designated to receive attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by the Licensor (including by pseudonym if designated);\par
                a copyright notice;\par
                a notice that refers to this Public License;\par
                a notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties;\par
                a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent reasonably practicable;\par
            indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and retain an indication of any previous modifications; and\par
            indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this Public License.\par
        For the avoidance of doubt, You do not have permission under this Public License to Share Adapted Material.\par
        You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or hyperlink to a resource that includes the required information.\par
        If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably practicable.\par
\par
Section 4 \endash  Sui Generis Database Rights.\par
\par
Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:\par
\par
    for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database, provided You do not Share Adapted Material;\par
    if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and\par
    You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.\par
\par
For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.\par
\par
Section 5 \endash  Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.\par
\par
    Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available, and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This includes, without limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors, whether or not known or discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer may not apply to You.\par
    To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise for any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary, or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this Public License or use of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to You.\par
\par
    The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.\par
\par
Section 6 \endash  Term and Termination.\par
\par
    This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically.\par
\par
    Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates:\par
        automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or\par
        upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.\par
    For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License.\par
    For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License.\par
    Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License.\par
\par
Section 7 \endash  Other Terms and Conditions.\par
\par
    The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.\par
    Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.\par
\par
Section 8 \endash  Interpretation.\par
\par
    For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this Public License.\par
    To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions.\par
    No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor.\par
    Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or authority.\par

== GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE - Version 2.1\par
\par
```\par
 Version 2.1, February 1999\par
\par
Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\par
51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA\par
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\par
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\par
\par
[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts\par
 as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence\par
 the version number 2.1.]\par
\par
Preamble\par
\par
The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\par
\par
This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.\par
\par
When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do these things.\par
\par
To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\par
\par
For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you link other code with the library, you must provide complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\par
\par
We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\par
\par
To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know that what they have is not the original version, so that the original author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be introduced by others.\par
\par
Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any free program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a restrictive license from a patent holder. Therefore, we insist that any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\par
\par
Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and is quite different from the ordinary General Public License. We use this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those libraries into non-free programs.\par
\par
When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a combined work, a derivative of the original library. The ordinary General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the entire combination fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser General Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with the library.\par
\par
We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General Public License. It also provides other free software developers Less of an advantage over competing non-free programs. These disadvantages are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many libraries. However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain special circumstances.\par
\par
For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must be allowed to use the library. A more frequent case is that a free library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries. In this case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\par
\par
In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of free software. For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating system.\par
\par
Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run that program using a modified version of the Library.\par
\par
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library". The former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must be combined with the library in order to run.\par
TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\par
\par
0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License"). Each licensee is addressed as "you".\par
\par
A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\par
\par
The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work which has been distributed under these terms. A "work based on the Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term "modification".)\par
\par
"Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the library.\par
\par
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does and what the program that uses the Library does.\par
\par
1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the Library.\par
\par
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\par
\par
2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\par
\par
    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\par
    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\par
    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\par
    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply such function or table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.\par
\par
    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function or table used by this function must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square root function must still compute square roots.)\par
\par
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\par
\par
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Library.\par
\par
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.\par
\par
3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in these notices.\par
\par
Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\par
\par
This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library into a program that is not a library.\par
\par
4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange.\par
\par
If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\par
\par
5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library". Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License.\par
\par
However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the library". The executable is therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\par
\par
When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\par
\par
If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.)\par
\par
Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\par
\par
6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications.\par
\par
You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one of these things:\par
\par
    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the modified definitions.)\par
    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a copy of the library already present on the user's computer system, rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the modified version is interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.\par
    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution.\par
    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified materials from the same place.\par
    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\par
\par
For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception, the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.\par
\par
It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library together in an executable that you distribute.\par
\par
7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two things:\par
\par
    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the Sections above.\par
    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\par
\par
8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\par
\par
9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it.\par
\par
10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\par
\par
11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\par
\par
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\par
\par
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.\par
\par
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.\par
\par
12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.\par
\par
13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\par
\par
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a license version number, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\par
\par
14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\par
\par
NO WARRANTY\par
\par
15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\par
\par
16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\par

If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that everyone can redistribute and change. You can do so by permitting redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the ordinary General Public License).\par
\par
To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\par
\par
one line to give the library's name and an idea of what it does.\par

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\par
\par
This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.\par
0. Additional Definitions.\par
\par
As used herein, \ldblquote this License\rdblquote  refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser General Public License, and the \ldblquote GNU GPL\rdblquote  refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\par
\par
\ldblquote The Library\rdblquote  refers to a covered work governed by this License, other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.\par
\par
An \ldblquote Application\rdblquote  is any work that makes use of an interface provided by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library. Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode of using an interface provided by the Library.\par
\par
A \ldblquote Combined Work\rdblquote  is a work produced by combining or linking an Application with the Library. The particular version of the Library with which the Combined Work was made is also called the \ldblquote Linked Version\rdblquote .\par
\par
The \ldblquote Minimal Corresponding Source\rdblquote  for a Combined Work means the Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.\par
\par
The \ldblquote Corresponding Application Code\rdblquote  for a Combined Work means the object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.\par
1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.\par
\par
You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.\par
2. Conveying Modified Versions.\par
\par
If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified version:\par
\par
    a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the function or data, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or\par
    b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of this License applicable to that copy.\par
\par
3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.\par
\par
The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from a header file that is part of the Library. You may convey such object code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:\par
\par
    a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.\par
    b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.\par
\par
4. Combined Works.\par
\par
You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that, taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of the following:\par
\par
    a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.\par
    b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.\par
    c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.\par
    d) Do one of the following:\par
        0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.\par
        1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked Version.\par
    e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise be required to provide such information under section 6 of the GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is necessary to install and execute a modified version of the Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.)\par
\par
5. Combined Libraries.\par
\par
You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side by side in a single library together with other library facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your choice, if you do both of the following:\par
\par
    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities, conveyed under the terms of this License.\par
    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\par
\par
6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.\par
\par
The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\par
\par
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Lesser General Public License \ldblquote or any later version\rdblquote  applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that published version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\par
\par
If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the Library.\par

 Version 2, June 1991\par
\par
Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\par
51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301, USA\par
\par
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\par
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\par
\par
Preamble\par
\par
The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.\par
\par
When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\par
\par
To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\par
\par
For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\par
\par
We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.\par
\par
Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.\par
\par
Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\par
\par
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.\par
TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\par
\par
0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".\par
\par
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.\par
\par
1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.\par
\par
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\par
\par
2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\par
\par
    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\par
    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\par
    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\par
\par
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\par
\par
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Program.\par
\par
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.\par
\par
3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\par
\par
    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\par
    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\par
    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\par
\par
The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.\par
\par
If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\par
\par
4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\par
\par
5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.\par
\par
6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.\par
\par
7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\par
\par
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\par
\par
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.\par
\par
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.\par
\par
8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.\par
\par
9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\par
\par
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\par
\par
10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\par
\par
NO WARRANTY\par
\par
11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\par
\par
12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\par
END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\par
How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\par
\par
If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\par
\par
To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\par
\par
one line to give the program's name and an idea of what it does.\par
Copyright (C) yyyy  name of author\par
\par
This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\par
modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License\par
as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2\par
of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\par
\par
This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\par
but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\par
MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\par
GNU General Public License for more details.\par
\par
You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\par
along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software\par
Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301, USA.\par
\par
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\par
\par
If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\par
\par
Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author\par
Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details\par
type `show w'.  This is free software, and you are welcome\par
to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c'\par
for details.\par
\par
The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\par
\par
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:\par

== "CLASSPATH" EXCEPTION TO THE GPL\par
\par
```\par
Certain source files distributed by Oracle America and/or its affiliates\par
are subject to the following clarification and special exception to the GPLv2,\par
based on the GNU Project exception for its Classpath libraries, known as the\par
GNU Classpath Exception, but only where Oracle has expressly included in the\par
particular source file's header the words "Oracle designates this particular\par
file as subject to the "Classpath" exception as provided by Oracle in the\par
LICENSE file that accompanied this code."\par
\par
You should also note that Oracle includes multiple, independent programs in\par
this software package. Some of those programs are provided under licenses\par
deemed incompatible with the GPLv2 by the Free Software Foundation and others.\par
For example, the package includes programs licensed under the Apache License,\par
Version 2.0. Such programs are licensed to you under their original licenses.\par
\par
Oracle facilitates your further distribution of this package by adding the\par
Classpath Exception to the necessary parts of its GPLv2 code, which permits you\par
to use that code in combination with other independent modules not licensed\par
under the GPLv2. However, note that this would not permit you to commingle code\par
under an incompatible license with Oracle's GPLv2 licensed code by, for\par
example, cutting and pasting such code into a file also containing Oracle's\par
GPLv2 licensed code and then distributing the result.\par
\par
Additionally, if you were to remove the Classpath Exception from any of the\par
files to which it applies and distribute the result, you would likely be\par
required to license some or all of the other code in that distribution under\par
the GPLv2 as well, and since the GPLv2 is incompatible with the license terms\par
of some items included in the distribution by Oracle, removing the Classpath\par
Exception could therefore effectively compromise your ability to further\par
distribute the package.\par
\par
Proceed with caution and we recommend that you obtain the advice of a lawyer\par
skilled in open source matters before removing the Classpath Exception or\par
making modifications to this package which may subsequently be redistributed\par
and/or involve the use of third party software.\par
\par
CLASSPATH EXCEPTION\par
\par
Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is making a\par
combined work based on this library. Thus, the terms and conditions of the GNU\par
General Public License version 2 cover the whole combination.\par
\par
As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you\par
permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an\par
executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent modules, and\par
to copy and distribute the resulting executable under terms of your choice,\par
provided that you also meet, for each linked independent module, the terms and\par
conditions of the license of that module. An independent module is a module\par
which is not derived from or based on this library. If you modify this library,\par
you may extend this exception to your version of the library, but you are not\par
obligated to do so. If you do not wish to do so, delete this exception\par
statement from your version.\par

     #  Free Software applies to the current dictionary as well.\par
     #\par
     #  Each User may also freely distribute the Program, whether in its\par
     #  original form or modified, to any third party or parties, PROVIDED\par
     #  that the provisions of Section 3 ("NO WARRANTY") will ALWAYS appear\par
     #  on, or be attached to, the Program, which is distributed substantially\par
     #  in the same form as set out herein and that such intended\par
     #  distribution, if actually made, will neither violate or otherwise\par
     #  contravene any of the laws and regulations of the countries having\par
     #  jurisdiction over the User or the intended distribution itself.\par
     #\par
     #  NO WARRANTY\par
     #\par
     #  The program was produced on an experimental basis in the course of the\par
     #  research and development conducted during the project and is provided\par
     #  to users as so produced on an experimental basis.  Accordingly, the\par
     #  program is provided without any warranty whatsoever, whether express,\par
     #  implied, statutory or otherwise.  The term "warranty" used herein\par
     #  includes, but is not limited to, any warranty of the quality,\par
     #  performance, merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose of\par
     #  the program and the nonexistence of any infringement or violation of\par
     #  any right of any third party.\par
     #\par
     #  Each user of the program will agree and understand, and be deemed to\par
     #  have agreed and understood, that there is no warranty whatsoever for\par
     #  the program and, accordingly, the entire risk arising from or\par
     #  otherwise connected with the program is assumed by the user.\par
     #\par
     #  Therefore, neither ICOT, the copyright holder, or any other\par
     #  organization that participated in or was otherwise related to the\par
     #  development of the program and their respective officials, directors,\par
     #  officers and other employees shall be held liable for any and all\par
     #  damages, including, without limitation, general, special, incidental\par
     #  and consequential damages, arising out of or otherwise in connection\par
     #  with the use or inability to use the program or any product, material\par
     #  or result produced or otherwise obtained by using the program,\par
     #  regardless of whether they have been advised of, or otherwise had\par
     #  knowledge of, the possibility of such damages at any time during the\par
     #  project or thereafter.  Each user will be deemed to have agreed to the\par
     #  foregoing by his or her commencement of use of the program.  The term\par
     #  "use" as used herein includes, but is not limited to, the use,\par
     #  modification, copying and distribution of the program and the\par
     #  production of secondary products from the program.\par
     #\par
     #  In the case where the program, whether in its original form or\par
     #  modified, was distributed or delivered to or received by a user from\par
     #  any person, organization or entity other than ICOT, unless it makes or\par
     #  grants independently of ICOT any specific warranty to the user in\par
     #  writing, such person, organization or entity, will also be exempted\par
     #  from and not be held liable to the user for any such damages as noted\par
     #  above as far as the program is concerned.\par

    5. Time Zone Database\par
\par
      ICU uses the public domain data and code derived from Time Zone\par
    Database for its time zone support. The ownership of the TZ database\par
    is explained in BCP 175: Procedure for Maintaining the Time Zone\par
    Database section 7.\par
\par
     # 7.  Database Ownership\par
     #\par
     #    The TZ database itself is not an IETF Contribution or an IETF\par
     #    document.  Rather it is a pre-existing and regularly updated work\par
     #    that is in the public domain, and is intended to remain in the\par
     #    public domain.  Therefore, BCPs 78 [RFC5378] and 79 [RFC3979] do\par
     #    not apply to the TZ Database or contributions that individuals make\par
     #    to it.  Should any claims be made and substantiated against the TZ\par
     #    Database, the organization that is providing the IANA\par
     #    Considerations defined in this RFC, under the memorandum of\par
     #    understanding with the IETF, currently ICANN, may act in accordance\par
     #    with all competent court orders.  No ownership claims will be made\par
     #    by ICANN or the IETF Trust on the database or the code.  Any person\par
     #    making a contribution to the database or code waives all rights to\par
     #    future claims in that contribution or in the TZ Database.\par

    Copyright (c) 2000-2006, The Perl Foundation.\par
\par
    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\par
    of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\par
\par
    Preamble\par
\par
    This license establishes the terms under which a given free software\par
    Package may be copied, modified, distributed, and/or redistributed.\par
    The intent is that the Copyright Holder maintains some artistic\par
    control over the development of that Package while still keeping the\par
    Package available as open source and free software.\par
\par
    You are always permitted to make arrangements wholly outside of this\par
    license directly with the Copyright Holder of a given Package.  If the\par
    terms of this license do not permit the full use that you propose to\par
    make of the Package, you should contact the Copyright Holder and seek\par
    a different licensing arrangement.\par
\par
    Definitions\par
\par
        "Copyright Holder" means the individual(s) or organization(s)\par
        named in the copyright notice for the entire Package.\par
\par
        "Contributor" means any party that has contributed code or other\par
        material to the Package, in accordance with the Copyright Holder's\par
        procedures.\par
\par
        "You" and "your" means any person who would like to copy,\par
        distribute, or modify the Package.\par
\par
        "Package" means the collection of files distributed by the\par
        Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection and/or of\par
        those files. A given Package may consist of either the Standard\par
        Version, or a Modified Version.\par
\par
        "Distribute" means providing a copy of the Package or making it\par
        accessible to anyone else, or in the case of a company or\par
        organization, to others outside of your company or organization.\par
\par
        "Distributor Fee" means any fee that you charge for Distributing\par
        this Package or providing support for this Package to another\par
        party.  It does not mean licensing fees.\par
\par
        "Standard Version" refers to the Package if it has not been\par
        modified, or has been modified only in ways explicitly requested\par
        by the Copyright Holder.\par
\par
        "Modified Version" means the Package, if it has been changed, and\par
        such changes were not explicitly requested by the Copyright\par
        Holder.\par
\par
        "Original License" means this Artistic License as Distributed with\par
        the Standard Version of the Package, in its current version or as\par
        it may be modified by The Perl Foundation in the future.\par
\par
        "Source" form means the source code, documentation source, and\par
        configuration files for the Package.\par
\par
        "Compiled" form means the compiled bytecode, object code, binary,\par
        or any other form resulting from mechanical transformation or\par
        translation of the Source form.\par
\par
    Permission for Use and Modification Without Distribution\par
\par
    (1)  You are permitted to use the Standard Version and create and use\par
    Modified Versions for any purpose without restriction, provided that\par
    you do not Distribute the Modified Version.\par
\par
    Permissions for Redistribution of the Standard Version\par
\par
    (2)  You may Distribute verbatim copies of the Source form of the\par
    Standard Version of this Package in any medium without restriction,\par
    either gratis or for a Distributor Fee, provided that you duplicate\par
    all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.  At\par
    your discretion, such verbatim copies may or may not include a\par
    Compiled form of the Package.\par
\par
    (3)  You may apply any bug fixes, portability changes, and other\par
    modifications made available from the Copyright Holder.  The resulting\par
    Package will still be considered the Standard Version, and as such\par
    will be subject to the Original License.\par
\par
    Distribution of Modified Versions of the Package as Source\par
\par
    (4)  You may Distribute your Modified Version as Source (either gratis\par
    or for a Distributor Fee, and with or without a Compiled form of the\par
    Modified Version) provided that you clearly document how it differs\par
    from the Standard Version, including, but not limited to, documenting\par
    any non-standard features, executables, or modules, and provided that\par
    you do at least ONE of the following:\par
\par
        (a)  make the Modified Version available to the Copyright Holder\par
        of the Standard Version, under the Original License, so that the\par
        Copyright Holder may include your modifications in the Standard\par
        Version.\par
\par
        (b)  ensure that installation of your Modified Version does not\par
        prevent the user installing or running the Standard Version. In\par
        addition, the Modified Version must bear a name that is different\par
        from the name of the Standard Version.\par
\par
        (c)  allow anyone who receives a copy of the Modified Version to\par
        make the Source form of the Modified Version available to others\par
        under\par
\par
            (i)  the Original License or\par
\par
            (ii)  a license that permits the licensee to freely copy,\par
            modify and redistribute the Modified Version using the same\par
            licensing terms that apply to the copy that the licensee\par
            received, and requires that the Source form of the Modified\par
            Version, and of any works derived from it, be made freely\par
            available in that license fees are prohibited but Distributor\par
            Fees are allowed.\par
\par
    Distribution of Compiled Forms of the Standard Version\par
    or Modified Versions without the Source\par
\par
    (5)  You may Distribute Compiled forms of the Standard Version without\par
    the Source, provided that you include complete instructions on how to\par
    get the Source of the Standard Version.  Such instructions must be\par
    valid at the time of your distribution.  If these instructions, at any\par
    time while you are carrying out such distribution, become invalid, you\par
    must provide new instructions on demand or cease further distribution.\par
    If you provide valid instructions or cease distribution within thirty\par
    days after you become aware that the instructions are invalid, then\par
    you do not forfeit any of your rights under this license.\par
\par
    (6)  You may Distribute a Modified Version in Compiled form without\par
    the Source, provided that you comply with Section 4 with respect to\par
    the Source of the Modified Version.\par
\par
    Aggregating or Linking the Package\par
\par
    (7)  You may aggregate the Package (either the Standard Version or\par
    Modified Version) with other packages and Distribute the resulting\par
    aggregation provided that you do not charge a licensing fee for the\par
    Package.  Distributor Fees are permitted, and licensing fees for other\par
    components in the aggregation are permitted. The terms of this license\par
    apply to the use and Distribution of the Standard or Modified Versions\par
    as included in the aggregation.\par
\par
    (8) You are permitted to link Modified and Standard Versions with\par
    other works, to embed the Package in a larger work of your own, or to\par
    build stand-alone binary or bytecode versions of applications that\par
    include the Package, and Distribute the result without restriction,\par
    provided the result does not expose a direct interface to the Package.\par
\par
    Items That are Not Considered Part of a Modified Version\par
\par
    (9) Works (including, but not limited to, modules and scripts) that\par
    merely extend or make use of the Package, do not, by themselves, cause\par
    the Package to be a Modified Version.  In addition, such works are not\par
    considered parts of the Package itself, and are not subject to the\par
    terms of this license.\par
\par
    General Provisions\par
\par
    (10)  Any use, modification, and distribution of the Standard or\par
    Modified Versions is governed by this Artistic License. By using,\par
    modifying or distributing the Package, you accept this license. Do not\par
    use, modify, or distribute the Package, if you do not accept this\par
    license.\par
\par
    (11)  If your Modified Version has been derived from a Modified\par
    Version made by someone other than you, you are nevertheless required\par
    to ensure that your Modified Version complies with the requirements of\par
    this license.\par
\par
    (12)  This license does not grant you the right to use any trademark,\par
    service mark, tradename, or logo of the Copyright Holder.\par
\par
    (13)  This license includes the non-exclusive, worldwide,\par
    free-of-charge patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell,\par
    sell, import and otherwise transfer the Package with respect to any\par
    patent claims licensable by the Copyright Holder that are necessarily\par
    infringed by the Package. If you institute patent litigation\par
    (including a cross-claim or counterclaim) against any party alleging\par
    that the Package constitutes direct or contributory patent\par
    infringement, then this Artistic License to you shall terminate on the\par
    date that such litigation is filed.\par
\par
    (14)  Disclaimer of Warranty:\par
    THE PACKAGE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER AND CONTRIBUTORS "AS\par
    IS' AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES. THE IMPLIED\par
    WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR\par
    NON-INFRINGEMENT ARE DISCLAIMED TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY YOUR LOCAL\par
    LAW. UNLESS REQUIRED BY LAW, NO COPYRIGHT HOLDER OR CONTRIBUTOR WILL\par
    BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL\par
    DAMAGES ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OF THE PACKAGE, EVEN IF\par
    ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.\par

\par
      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical\par
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but\par
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,\par
      and conversions to other media types.\par
\par
      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or\par
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a\par
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work\par
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).\par
\par
      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object\par
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the\par
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications\par
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes\par
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain\par
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,\par
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.\par
\par
      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including\par
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions\par
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally\par
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner\par
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of\par
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"\par
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent\par
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to\par
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,\par
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the\par
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but\par

      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."\par
\par
      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity\par
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and\par
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.\par
\par
   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of\par
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,\par
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable\par
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,\par
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the\par
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.\par
\par
   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of\par
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,\par
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable\par
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,\par
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,\par
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable\par
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their\par
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)\par
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You\par
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a\par
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work\par
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct\par
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses\par
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate\par
      as of the date such litigation is filed.\par
\par
   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\par
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\par
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\par
      meet the following conditions:\par
\par
      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\par
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\par
\par
      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\par
          stating that You changed the files; and\par
\par
      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\par
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\par
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\par
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\par
          the Derivative Works; and\par
\par
      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its\par
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\par
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\par
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\par
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\par
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\par
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\par
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\par
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\par
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\par
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\par
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\par
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\par
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\par
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\par
          as modifying the License.\par
\par
      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\par
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\par
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\par
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\par
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\par
      the conditions stated in this License.\par
\par
   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\par
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\par
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\par
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\par
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\par
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\par
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\par
\par
   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\par
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\par
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\par
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\par
\par
   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\par
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\par
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,\par
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\par
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\par
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\par
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\par
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\par
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\par
\par
   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\par
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\par
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\par
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\par
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\par
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\par
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\par
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\par
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\par
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\par
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\par
\par
   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\par
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\par
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\par
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\par
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\par
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\par
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\par
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\par
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\par
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\par
\par
   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\par

== MICROSOFT SOFTWARE LICENSE TERMS\par
\par
```\par
MICROSOFT VISUAL STUDIO CODE\par
\par
These license terms are an agreement between you and Microsoft Corporation (or based on where you live, one of its affiliates). They apply to the software named above. The terms also apply to any Microsoft services or updates for the software, except to the extent those have different terms.\par
\par
IF YOU COMPLY WITH THESE LICENSE TERMS, YOU HAVE THE RIGHTS BELOW.\par
\par
    1. INSTALLATION AND USE RIGHTS.\par
        a. General. You may use any number of copies of the software to develop and test your applications, including deployment within your internal corporate network.\par
        b. Demo use. The uses permitted above include use of the software in demonstrating your applications.\par
        c. Third Party Components. The software may include third party components with separate legal notices or governed by other agreements, as may be described in the ThirdPartyNotices file accompanying the software.\par
        d. Extensions. The software gives you the option to download other Microsoft and third party software packages from our extension marketplace or package managers. Those packages are under their own licenses, and not this agreement. Microsoft does not distribute, license or provide any warranties for any of the third party packages. By accessing or using our extension marketplace, you agree to the extension marketplace terms located at {{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK https://aka.ms/vsmarketplace-ToU }}{\fldrslt{https://aka.ms/vsmarketplace-ToU\ul0\cf0}}}}\f0\fs22 .\par
    2. DATA.\par
        a. Data Collection. The software may collect information about you and your use of the software, and send that to Microsoft. Microsoft may use this information to provide services and improve our products and services. You may opt-out of many of these scenarios, but not all, as described in the product documentation located at {{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/supporting/faq#_how-to-disable-telemetry-reporting }}{\fldrslt{https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/supporting/faq#_how-to-disable-telemetry-reporting\ul0\cf0}}}}\f0\fs22 . There may also be some features in the software that may enable you and Microsoft to collect data from users of your applications. If you use these features, you must comply with applicable law, including providing appropriate notices to users of your applications together with Microsoft\rquote s privacy statement. Our privacy statement is located at {{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=824704 }}{\fldrslt{https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=824704\ul0\cf0}}}}\f0\fs22 . You can learn more about data collection and use in the help documentation and our privacy statement. Your use of the software operates as your consent to these practices.\par
        c. Processing of Personal Data. To the extent Microsoft is a processor or subprocessor of personal data in connection with the software, Microsoft makes the commitments in the European Union General Data Protection Regulation Terms of the Online Services Terms to all customers effective May 25, 2018, at {{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK https://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=9840733 }}{\fldrslt{https://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=9840733\ul0\cf0}}}}\f0\fs22 .\par
    3. UPDATES. The software may periodically check for updates and download and install them for you. You may obtain updates only from Microsoft or authorized sources. Microsoft may need to update your system to provide you with updates. You agree to receive these automatic updates without any additional notice. Updates may not include or support all existing software features, services, or peripheral devices. If you do not want automatic updates, you may turn them off by following the instructions in the documentation at {{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=616397 }}{\fldrslt{https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=616397\ul0\cf0}}}}\f0\fs22 .\par
    4. FEEDBACK. If you give feedback about the software to Microsoft, you give to Microsoft, without charge, the right to use, share and commercialize your feedback in any way and for any purpose. You will not give feedback that is subject to a license that requires Microsoft to license its software or documentation to third parties because we include your feedback in them. These rights survive this agreement.\par
    5. SCOPE OF LICENSE. This license applies to the Visual Studio Code product. Source code for Visual Studio Code is available at {{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode }}{\fldrslt{https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode\ul0\cf0}}}}\f0\fs22  under the MIT license agreement. The software is licensed, not sold. This agreement only gives you some rights to use the software. Microsoft reserves all other rights. Unless applicable law gives you more rights despite this limitation, you may use the software only as expressly permitted in this agreement. In doing so, you must comply with any technical limitations in the software that only allow you to use it in certain ways. You may not\par
        reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble the software, or otherwise attempt to derive the source code for the software except and solely to the extent required by third party licensing terms governing use of certain open source components that may be included in the software;\par
        remove, minimize, block or modify any notices of Microsoft or its suppliers in the software;\par
        use the software in any way that is against the law;\par
        share, publish, rent or lease the software, or provide the software as a stand-alone offering for others to use.\par
    6. SUPPORT SERVICES. Because this software is \ldblquote as is,\rdblquote  we may not provide support services for it.\par
    7. ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This agreement, and the terms for supplements, updates, Internet-based services and support services that you use, are the entire agreement for the software and support services.\par
    8. EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. You must comply with all domestic and international export laws and regulations that apply to the software, which include restrictions on destinations, end-users, and end use. For further information on export restrictions, see {{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK https://www.microsoft.com/exporting }}{\fldrslt{https://www.microsoft.com/exporting\ul0\cf0}}}}\f0\fs22 .\par
    9. APPLICABLE LAW. If you acquired the software in the United States, Washington law applies to interpretation of and claims for breach of this agreement, and the laws of the state where you live apply to all other claims. If you acquired the software in any other country, its laws apply.\par
    10. CONSUMER RIGHTS; REGIONAL VARIATIONS. This agreement describes certain legal rights. You may have other rights, including consumer rights, under the laws of your state or country. Separate and apart from your relationship with Microsoft, you may also have rights with respect to the party from which you acquired the software. This agreement does not change those other rights if the laws of your state or country do not permit it to do so. For example, if you acquired the software in one of the below regions, or mandatory country law applies, then the following provisions apply to you:\par
        a. Australia. You have statutory guarantees under the Australian Consumer Law and nothing in this agreement is intended to affect those rights.\par
        b. Canada. If you acquired this software in Canada, you may stop receiving updates by turning off the automatic update feature, disconnecting your device from the Internet (if and when you re-connect to the Internet, however, the software will resume checking for and installing updates), or uninstalling the software. The product documentation, if any, may also specify how to turn off updates for your specific device or software.\par
        c. Germany and Austria.\par
            Warranty. The properly licensed software will perform substantially as described in any Microsoft materials that accompany the software. However, Microsoft gives no contractual guarantee in relation to the licensed software.\par
            Limitation of Liability. In case of intentional conduct, gross negligence, claims based on the Product Liability Act, as well as, in case of death or personal or physical injury, Microsoft is liable according to the statutory law.\par
\par
        Subject to the foregoing clause (ii), Microsoft will only be liable for slight negligence if Microsoft is in breach of such material contractual obligations, the fulfillment of which facilitate the due performance of this agreement, the breach of which would endanger the purpose of this agreement and the compliance with which a party may constantly trust in (so-called "cardinal obligations"). In other cases of slight negligence, Microsoft will not be liable for slight negligence.\par
    11. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. The software is licensed \ldblquote as-is.\rdblquote  You bear the risk of using it. Microsoft gives no express warranties, guarantees or conditions. To the extent permitted under your local laws, Microsoft excludes the implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement.\par
\par
    12. LIMITATION ON AND EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES. You can recover from Microsoft and its suppliers only direct damages up to U.S. $5.00. You cannot recover any other damages, including consequential, lost profits, special, indirect or incidental damages.\par
\par
    This limitation applies to (a) anything related to the software, services, content (including code) on third party Internet sites, or third party applications; and (b) claims for breach of contract, breach of warranty, guarantee or condition, strict liability, negligence, or other tort to the extent permitted by applicable law.\par
\par
    It also applies even if Microsoft knew or should have known about the possibility of the damages. The above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you because your state or country may not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental, consequential or other damages.\par

     effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first distributes\par
     such Contribution.\par
\par
2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope\par
\par
     The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under this\par
     License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the distribution\par

        Contributions.\par
\par
     This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks, or\par
     logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with the\par
     notice requirements in Section 3.4).\par
\par
2.4. Subsequent Licenses\par
\par
     No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to\par
     distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this License\par
     (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted\par
     under the terms of Section 3.3).\par
\par
2.5. Representation\par
\par
     Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its Contributions\par
     are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights to grant the\par
     rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.\par
\par
2.6. Fair Use\par
\par
     This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under applicable\par
     copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other equivalents.\par
\par
2.7. Conditions\par
\par
     Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted in\par
     Section 2.1.\par
\par
\par
3. Responsibilities\par
\par
3.1. Distribution of Source Form\par
\par
     All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any\par
     Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under the\par
     terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form\par
     of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how\par
     they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not attempt to alter or\par
     restrict the recipients\rquote  rights in the Source Code Form.\par
\par
3.2. Distribution of Executable Form\par
\par
     If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:\par
\par
     a. such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form,\par
        as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the\par
        Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by\par
        reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost\par
        of distribution to the recipient; and\par
\par
     b. You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License,\par
        or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the license for\par
        the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients\rquote\par
        rights in the Source Code Form under this License.\par
\par
3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work\par
\par
     You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,\par
     provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for the\par
     Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software\par
     with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered\par
     Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits\par
     You to additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of\par
     such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at\par
     their option, further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of\par
     either this License or such Secondary License(s).\par
\par
3.4. Notices\par
\par
     You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including\par
     copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations\par
     of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered\par
     Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the extent\par
     required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.\par
\par
3.5. Application of Additional Terms\par
\par
     You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,\par
     indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered\par
     Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf\par
     of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such\par
     warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You\par
     alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any\par
     liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,\par
     indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional\par
     disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any\par
     jurisdiction.\par
\par
4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation\par
\par
   If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License\par
   with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial\par
   order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License\par
   to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code\par
   they affect. Such description must be placed in a text file included with all\par
   distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to the\par
   extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be\par
   sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to\par
   understand it.\par
\par
5. Termination\par
\par
5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You\par
     fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant,\par
     then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor\par
     are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor\par
     explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis,\par
     if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some\par
     reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into compliance.\par
     Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an\par
     ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by\par
     some reasonable means, this is the first time You have received notice of\par
     non-compliance with this License from such Contributor, and You become\par
     compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt of the notice.\par
\par
5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent\par
     infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims,\par
     and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or\par
     indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and\par
     all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License\par
     shall terminate.\par
\par
5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user\par
     license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been\par
     validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to\par
     termination shall survive termination.\par
\par
6. Disclaimer of Warranty\par
\par
   Covered Software is provided under this License on an \ldblquote as is\rdblquote  basis, without\par
   warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including,\par
   without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects,\par
   merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire\par
   risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You.\par
   Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any\par
   Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or\par
   correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this\par
   License. No use of  any Covered Software is authorized under this License\par
   except under this disclaimer.\par
\par
7. Limitation of Liability\par
\par
   Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including\par
   negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who\par
   distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any\par
   direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any\par
   character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of\par
   goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\par
   other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been\par
   informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability\par
   shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such\par
   party\rquote s negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation.\par
   Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or\par
   consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.\par
\par
8. Litigation\par
\par
   Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of\par
   a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business\par
   and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without\par
   reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall\par
   prevent a party\rquote s ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.\par
\par
9. Miscellaneous\par
\par
   This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter\par
   hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such\par
   provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it\par
   enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a\par
   contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe\par
   this License against a Contributor.\par
\par
\par
10. Versions of the License\par
\par
10.1. New Versions\par
\par
      Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section\par
      10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or\par
      publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a\par
      distinguishing version number.\par
\par
10.2. Effect of New Versions\par
\par
      You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version of\par
      the License under which You originally received the Covered Software, or\par
      under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license\par
      steward.\par
\par
10.3. Modified Versions\par
\par
      If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to\par
      create a new license for such software, you may create and use a modified\par
      version of this License if you rename the license and remove any\par
      references to the name of the license steward (except to note that such\par
      modified license differs from this License).\par
\par
10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary Licenses\par
      If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With\par
      Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the\par
      notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.\par

directory) where a recipient would be likely to look for such a notice.\par
\par
