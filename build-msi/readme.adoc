== Building IDEASY MSI Package with WixToolSet v4

=== Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- .NET SDK 6.0 or later
- dotnet (also possible via ideasy)
- Wixtoolset v.4 `dotnet tool install --global wix`

=== Steps to Build the MSI Package

1. **Add the necessary WiX extensions**

   wix extension add WixToolset.UI.wixext
   wix extension add WixToolset.Util.wixext

2. **Build the MSI package**

   wix build Package.wxs WixUI_OwnSetup.wxs -loc Package.en-us.wxl -ext WixToolset.UI.wixext -ext WixToolset.Util.wixext -o ideasy.msi

== Debugging Installation Issues

To debug the installation process and capture detailed logs, use the following command:

```
msiexec /i IDEASY.msi /l*v install.log
```

This will create a verbose log file (`install.log`) that can help diagnose installation issues.

A pre-built MSI file (ideasy.msi) is also included for testing without the need to build it yourself.

== Additional Notes

- Ensure that all dependencies and required WiX extensions are correctly installed.
- Verify the generated MSI file to confirm that all components are included as expected.
- Use the log file for troubleshooting any issues encountered during installation.
- Use CMD or Powershell
- Create a folder `msi-setup` inside the `build-msi` that contains the installation files.
The content of that folder will be moved during installation

== Files

link:Package.wxs[Package.wxs]

This file serves as the entry point for the Windows installation process.
It defines custom actions, properties, and the installation logic.
Additionally, it specifies which files should be installed during the process.

link:WixUI_OwnSetup.wxs[WixUI_OwnSetup.wxs]

This file contains all elements related to the UI for the installation.
You can configure the sequence of UI dialogs, add triggers for custom actions based on UI elements and customize dialogs like the InstallPathDlg, where users can choose their preferred installation directory.
Most of the current UI is inherited by `WixUI_InstallDir.wxs` from WixUI dialog library in WixToolSet.

link:Package.en-us.wxl[Package.en-us.wxl]

A localization file containing text strings for English (US).
By adding further localization files, we can support additional languages.
