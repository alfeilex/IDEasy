The source code of this product is available under free and open-source licenses.\par
More specifically, most of the source code is available under the Apache License 2.0. Only code that is directly included into the product IDEasy is part of what you download as our product and therefore considered as derivative work. Such code included in this product is either also unter Apache License 2.0 or another free and open-source licenses that is listed below.\par
However, our product allows to install and run other software. All of this is optional and can be configured as needed. Since such software is executed as a seperated process and is fully optional, it is not to be considered as derivative work. Without IDEasy you just install such software manually and the only difference is that we automate this for you. However, due to automation you may not explicitly decide and notice what the license of such software is. Therefore, we list such software with their licenses explicitly below esp. those that require reproduction of the license text in the distribution. Before using our product and installig additional software with it you need to agree to such licenses and be aware of this.\par

\pard\li960\sb200\sa200\b0\f3\fs20 THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE PUBLIC LICENSE (\rdblquote AGREEMENT\rdblquote ). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT\rquote S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.\line\line 1. DEFINITIONS\line\line\rdblquote Contribution\rdblquote  means:\line\line a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and documentation distributed under this Agreement, and\line\line b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:\line\line i) changes to the Program, and\line\line ii) additions to the Program;\line\line where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution \lquote originates\rquote  from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor\rquote s behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.\line\line\rdblquote Contributor\rdblquote  means any person or entity that distributes the Program.\line\line\rdblquote Licensed Patents\rdblquote  mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when combined with the Program.\line\line\rdblquote Program\rdblquote  means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement.\line\line\rdblquote Recipient\rdblquote  means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, including all Contributors.\line\line 2. GRANT OF RIGHTS\line\line a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.\line\line b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.\line\line c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient\rquote s responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program.\line\line d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.\line\line 3. REQUIREMENTS\line\line A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its own license agreement, provided that:\line\line a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and\line\line b) its license agreement:\line\line i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;\line\line ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;\line\line iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and\line\line iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.\line\line When the Program is made available in source code form:\line\line a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and\line\line b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.\line\line Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the Program.\line\line Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.\line\line 4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION\line\line Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor (\rdblquote Commercial Contributor\rdblquote ) hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor (\rdblquote Indemnified Contributor\rdblquote ) against any losses, damages and costs (collectively \ldblquote Losses\rdblquote ) arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.\line\line For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor\rquote s responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.\line\line 5. NO WARRANTY\line\line EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN \ldblquote AS IS\rdblquote  BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement , including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.\line\line 6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY\line\line EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\line\line 7. GENERAL\line\line If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\line\line If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient\rquote s patent(s), then such Recipient\rquote s rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.\line\line All Recipient\rquote s rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient\rquote s rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient\rquote s obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.\line\line Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.\line\line This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.\par

\pard\sb200\b\f2\fs49 Chapter\~7.\~GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE - Version 2.1\par

\pard\li960\sb200\sa200\b0\f3\fs20  Version 2.1, February 1999\line\line Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\line 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA\line Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\line of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\line\line [This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts\line  as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence\line  the version number 2.1.]\line\line Preamble\line\line The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\line\line This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.\line\line When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do these things.\line\line To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\line\line For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you link other code with the library, you must provide complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\line\line We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\line\line To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know that what they have is not the original version, so that the original author\rquote s reputation will not be affected by problems that might be introduced by others.\line\line Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any free program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a restrictive license from a patent holder. Therefore, we insist that any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\line\line Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and is quite different from the ordinary General Public License. We use this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those libraries into non-free programs.\line\line When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a combined work, a derivative of the original library. The ordinary General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the entire combination fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser General Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with the library.\line\line We call this license the \ldblquote Lesser\rdblquote  General Public License because it does Less to protect the user\rquote s freedom than the ordinary General Public License. It also provides other free software developers Less of an advantage over competing non-free programs. These disadvantages are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many libraries. However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain special circumstances.\line\line For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must be allowed to use the library. A more frequent case is that a free library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries. In this case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\line\line In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of free software. For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating system.\line\line Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the users\rquote  freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run that program using a modified version of the Library.\line\line The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a \ldblquote work based on the library\rdblquote  and a \ldblquote work that uses the library\rdblquote . The former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must be combined with the library in order to run.\line TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\line\line 0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Lesser General Public License (also called \ldblquote this License\rdblquote ). Each licensee is addressed as \ldblquote you\rdblquote .\line\line A \ldblquote library\rdblquote  means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\line\line The \ldblquote Library\rdblquote , below, refers to any such software library or work which has been distributed under these terms. A \ldblquote work based on the Library\rdblquote  means either the Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term \ldblquote modification\rdblquote .)\line\line\rdblquote Source code\rdblquote  for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the library.\line\line Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does and what the program that uses the Library does.\line\line 1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library\rquote s complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the Library.\line\line You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\line\line 2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\line\line     a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\line     b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\line     c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\line     d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply such function or table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.\line\line     (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function or table used by this function must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square root function must still compute square roots.)\line\line These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\line\line Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Library.\line\line In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.\line\line 3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in these notices.\line\line Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\line\line This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library into a program that is not a library.\line\line 4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange.\line\line If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\line\line 5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called a \ldblquote work that uses the Library\rdblquote . Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License.\line\line However, linking a \ldblquote work that uses the Library\rdblquote  with the Library creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of the Library), rather than a \ldblquote work that uses the library\rdblquote . The executable is therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\line\line When a \ldblquote work that uses the Library\rdblquote  uses material from a header file that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\line\line If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.)\line\line Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\line\line 6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a \ldblquote work that uses the Library\rdblquote  with the Library to produce a work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the customer\rquote s own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications.\line\line You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one of these things:\line\line     a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable \ldblquote work that uses the Library\rdblquote , as object code and/or source code, so that the user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the modified definitions.)\line     b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a copy of the library already present on the user\rquote s computer system, rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the modified version is interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.\line     c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution.\line     d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified materials from the same place.\line     e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\line\line For an executable, the required form of the \ldblquote work that uses the Library\rdblquote  must include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception, the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.\line\line It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library together in an executable that you distribute.\line\line 7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two things:\line\line     a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the Sections above.\line     b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\line\line 8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\line\line 9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it.\line\line 10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients\rquote  exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\line\line 11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\line\line If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\line\line It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.\line\line This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.\line\line 12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.\line\line 13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\line\line Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \ldblquote any later version\rdblquote , you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a license version number, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\line\line 14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\line\line NO WARRANTY\line\line 15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.

IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\line END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\line How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\line\line If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that everyone can redistribute and change. You can do so by permitting redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the ordinary General Public License).\line\line To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the \ldblquote copyright\rdblquote  line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\line\line one line to give the library\rquote s name and an idea of what it does.\line Copyright (C) year  name of author\line\line This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\line modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public\line License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\line version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\line\line This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\line but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\line MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Additional Definitions.\line\line As used herein, \ldblquote this License\rdblquote  refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser General Public License, and the \ldblquote GNU GPL\rdblquote  refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\line\line\ldblquote The Library\rdblquote  refers to a covered work governed by this License, other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.\line\line An \ldblquote Application\rdblquote  is any work that makes use of an interface provided by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library. Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode of using an interface provided by the Library.\line\line A \ldblquote Combined Work\rdblquote  is a work produced by combining or linking an Application with the Library. The particular version of the Library with which the Combined Work was made is also called the \ldblquote Linked Version\rdblquote .\line\line The \ldblquote Minimal Corresponding Source\rdblquote  for a Combined Work means the Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.\line\line The \ldblquote Corresponding Application Code\rdblquote  for a Combined Work means the object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.\line 1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.\line\line You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.\line 2. Conveying Modified Versions.\line\line If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified version:\line\line     a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the function or data, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or\line     b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of this License applicable to that copy.\line\line 3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.\line\line The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from a header file that is part of the Library. You may convey such object code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:\line\line     a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.\line     b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.\line\line 4. Combined Works.\line\line You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that, taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of the following:\line\line     a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.\line     b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.\line     c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.\line     d) Do one of the following:\line         0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.\line         1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time a copy of the Library already present on the user\rquote s computer system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked Version.\line     e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise be required to provide such information under section 6 of the GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is necessary to install and execute a modified version of the Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.)\line\line 5. Combined Libraries.\line\line You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side by side in a single library together with other library facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your choice, if you do both of the following:\line\line     a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities, conveyed under the terms of this License.\line     b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\line\line 6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.\line\line The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\line\line Each version is given a distinguishing version number.

\pard\li960\sb200\sa200\b0\f3\fs20  Version 2, June 1991\line\line Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\line 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301, USA\line\line Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\line of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\line\line Preamble\line\line The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation\rquote s software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.\line\line When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\line\line To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\line\line For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\line\line We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.\line\line Also, for each author\rquote s protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors\rquote  reputations.\line\line Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone\rquote s free use or not licensed at all.\line\line The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.\line TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\line\line 0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License. The \ldblquote Program\rdblquote , below, refers to any such program or work, and a \ldblquote work based on the Program\rdblquote  means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term \ldblquote modification\rdblquote .) Each licensee is addressed as \ldblquote you\rdblquote .\line\line Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.\line\line 1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program\rquote s source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.\line\line You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\line\line 2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\line\line     a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\line     b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\line     c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\line\line These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\line\line Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Program.\line\line In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.\line\line 3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\line\line     a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\line     b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\line     c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\line\line The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.\line\line If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\line\line 4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\line\line 5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.\line\line 6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients\rquote  exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.\line\line 7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\line\line If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\line\line It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.\line\line This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.\line\line 8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.\line\line 9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\line\line Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \ldblquote any later version\rdblquote , you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\line\line 10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\line\line NO WARRANTY\line\line 11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \ldblquote AS IS\rdblquote  WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\line\line 12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\line END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\line How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\line\line If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\line\line To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the \ldblquote copyright\rdblquote  line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\line\line one line to give the program\rquote s name and an idea of what it does.\line Copyright (C) yyyy  name of author\line\line This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\line modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License\line as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2\line of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\line\line This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\line but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\line MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

\pard\li960\sb200\sa200\b0\f3\fs20 Certain source files distributed by Oracle America and/or its affiliates\line are subject to the following clarification and special exception to the GPLv2,\line based on the GNU Project exception for its Classpath libraries, known as the\line GNU Classpath Exception, but only where Oracle has expressly included in the\line particular source file\rquote s header the words \ldblquote Oracle designates this particular\line file as subject to the \ldblquote Classpath\rdblquote  exception as provided by Oracle in the\line LICENSE file that accompanied this code.\rdblquote\line\line You should also note that Oracle includes multiple, independent programs in\line this software package. Some of those programs are provided under licenses\line deemed incompatible with the GPLv2 by the Free Software Foundation and others.\line For example, the package includes programs licensed under the Apache License,\line Version 2.0. Such programs are licensed to you under their original licenses.\line\line Oracle facilitates your further distribution of this package by adding the\line Classpath Exception to the necessary parts of its GPLv2 code, which permits you\line to use that code in combination with other independent modules not licensed\line under the GPLv2. However, note that this would not permit you to commingle code\line under an incompatible license with Oracle\rquote s GPLv2 licensed code by, for\line example, cutting and pasting such code into a file also containing Oracle\rquote s\line GPLv2 licensed code and then distributing the result.\line\line Additionally, if you were to remove the Classpath Exception from any of the\line files to which it applies and distribute the result, you would likely be\line required to license some or all of the other code in that distribution under\line the GPLv2 as well, and since the GPLv2 is incompatible with the license terms\line of some items included in the distribution by Oracle, removing the Classpath\line Exception could therefore effectively compromise your ability to further\line distribute the package.\line\line Proceed with caution and we recommend that you obtain the advice of a lawyer\line skilled in open source matters before removing the Classpath Exception or\line making modifications to this package which may subsequently be redistributed\line and/or involve the use of third party software.\line\line CLASSPATH EXCEPTION\line\line Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is making a\line combined work based on this library. Thus, the terms and conditions of the GNU\line General Public License version 2 cover the whole combination.\line\line As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you\line permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an\line executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent modules, and\line to copy and distribute the resulting executable under terms of your choice,\line provided that you also meet, for each linked independent module, the terms and\line conditions of the license of that module. An independent module is a module\line which is not derived from or based on this library. If you modify this library,\line you may extend this exception to your version of the library, but you are not\line obligated to do so. If you do not wish to do so, delete this exception\line statement from your version.\par

Time Zone Database\line\line       ICU uses the public domain data and code derived from Time Zone\line     Database for its time zone support. The ownership of the TZ database\line     is explained in BCP 175: Procedure for Maintaining the Time Zone\line     Database section 7.\line\line      # 7.  Database Ownership\line      #\line      #    The TZ database itself is not an IETF Contribution or an IETF\line      #    document.  Rather it is a pre-existing and regularly updated work\line      #    that is in the public domain, and is intended to remain in the\line      #    public domain.  Therefore, BCPs 78 [RFC5378] and 79 [RFC3979] do\line      #    not apply to the TZ Database or contributions that individuals make\line      #    to it.  Should any claims be made and substantiated against the TZ\line      #    Database, the organization that is providing the IANA\line      #    Considerations defined in this RFC, under the memorandum of\line      #    understanding with the IETF, currently ICANN, may act in accordance\line      #    with all competent court orders.  No ownership claims will be made\line      #    by ICANN or the IETF Trust on the database or the code.  Any person\line      #    making a contribution to the database or code waives all rights to\line      #    future claims in that contribution or in the TZ Database.\line\line     6.

Such instructions must be\line     valid at the time of your distribution.  If these instructions, at any\line     time while you are carrying out such distribution, become invalid, you\line     must provide new instructions on demand or cease further distribution.\line     If you provide valid instructions or cease distribution within thirty\line     days after you become aware that the instructions are invalid, then\line     you do not forfeit any of your rights under this license.\line\line     (6)  You may Distribute a Modified Version in Compiled form without\line     the Source, provided that you comply with Section 4 with respect to\line     the Source of the Modified Version.\line\line     Aggregating or Linking the Package\line\line     (7)  You may aggregate the Package (either the Standard Version or\line     Modified Version) with other packages and Distribute the resulting\line     aggregation provided that you do not charge a licensing fee for the\line     Package.  Distributor Fees are permitted, and licensing fees for other\line     components in the aggregation are permitted. The terms of this license\line     apply to the use and Distribution of the Standard or Modified Versions\line     as included in the aggregation.\line\line     (8) You are permitted to link Modified and Standard Versions with\line     other works, to embed the Package in a larger work of your own, or to\line     build stand-alone binary or bytecode versions of applications that\line     include the Package, and Distribute the result without restriction,\line     provided the result does not expose a direct interface to the Package.\line\line     Items That are Not Considered Part of a Modified Version\line\line     (9) Works (including, but not limited to, modules and scripts) that\line     merely extend or make use of the Package, do not, by themselves, cause\line     the Package to be a Modified Version.  In addition, such works are not\line     considered parts of the Package itself, and are not subject to the\line     terms of this license.\line\line     General Provisions\line\line     (10)  Any use, modification, and distribution of the Standard or\line     Modified Versions is governed by this Artistic License.

INSTALLATION AND USE RIGHTS.\line         a. General. You may use any number of copies of the software to develop and test your applications, including deployment within your internal corporate network.\line         b. Demo use. The uses permitted above include use of the software in demonstrating your applications.\line         c. Third Party Components. The software may include third party components with separate legal notices or governed by other agreements, as may be described in the ThirdPartyNotices file accompanying the software.\line         d. Extensions. The software gives you the option to download other Microsoft and third party software packages from our extension marketplace or package managers. Those packages are under their own licenses, and not this agreement. Microsoft does not distribute, license or provide any warranties for any of the third party packages. By accessing or using our extension marketplace, you agree to the extension marketplace terms located at {{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK https://aka.ms/vsmarketplace-ToU }}{\fldrslt{https://aka.ms/vsmarketplace-ToU\ul0\cf0}}}}\f3\fs20 .\line     2. DATA.\line         a. Data Collection. The software may collect information about you and your use of the software, and send that to Microsoft. Microsoft may use this information to provide services and improve our products and services. You may opt-out of many of these scenarios, but not all, as described in the product documentation located at {{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/supporting/faq#_how-to-disable-telemetry-reporting }}{\fldrslt{https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/supporting/faq#_how-to-disable-telemetry-reporting\ul0\cf0}}}}\f3\fs20 .

UPDATES. The software may periodically check for updates and download and install them for you. You may obtain updates only from Microsoft or authorized sources. Microsoft may need to update your system to provide you with updates. You agree to receive these automatic updates without any additional notice. Updates may not include or support all existing software features, services, or peripheral devices. If you do not want automatic updates, you may turn them off by following the instructions in the documentation at {{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=616397 }}{\fldrslt{https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=616397\ul0\cf0}}}}\f3\fs20 .\line     4. FEEDBACK. If you give feedback about the software to Microsoft, you give to Microsoft, without charge, the right to use, share and commercialize your feedback in any way and for any purpose.

These rights survive this agreement.\line     5. SCOPE OF LICENSE. This license applies to the Visual Studio Code product. Source code for Visual Studio Code is available at {{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode }}{\fldrslt{https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode\ul0\cf0}}}}\f3\fs20  under the MIT license agreement. The software is licensed, not sold. This agreement only gives you some rights to use the software. Microsoft reserves all other rights. Unless applicable law gives you more rights despite this limitation, you may use the software only as expressly permitted in this agreement. In doing so, you must comply with any technical limitations in the software that only allow you to use it in certain ways. You may not\line         reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble the software, or otherwise attempt to derive the source code for the software except and solely to the extent required by third party licensing terms governing use of certain open source components that may be included in the software;\line         remove, minimize, block or modify any notices of Microsoft or its suppliers in the software;\line         use the software in any way that is against the law;\line         share, publish, rent or lease the software, or provide the software as a stand-alone offering for others to use.\line     6. SUPPORT SERVICES. Because this software is \ldblquote as is,\rdblquote  we may not provide support services for it.\line     7. ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This agreement, and the terms for supplements, updates, Internet-based services and support services that you use, are the entire agreement for the software and support services.\line     8. EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. You must comply with all domestic and international export laws and regulations that apply to the software, which include restrictions on destinations, end-users, and end use. For further information on export restrictions, see {{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK https://www.microsoft.com/exporting }}{\fldrslt{https://www.microsoft.com/exporting\ul0\cf0}}}}\f3\fs20 .\line     9. APPLICABLE LAW. If you acquired the software in the United States, Washington law applies to interpretation of and claims for breach of this agreement, and the laws of the state where you live apply to all other claims. If you acquired the software in any other country, its laws apply.\line     10. CONSUMER RIGHTS; REGIONAL VARIATIONS. This agreement describes certain legal rights. You may have other rights, including consumer rights, under the laws of your state or country. Separate and apart from your relationship with Microsoft, you may also have rights with respect to the party from which you acquired the software. This agreement does not change those other rights if the laws of your state or country do not permit it to do so. For example, if you acquired the software in one of the below regions, or mandatory country law applies, then the following provisions apply to you:\line         a. Australia. You have statutory guarantees under the Australian Consumer Law and nothing in this agreement is intended to affect those rights.\line         b. Canada. If you acquired this software in Canada, you may stop receiving updates by turning off the automatic update feature, disconnecting your device from the Internet (if and when you re-connect to the Internet, however, the software will resume checking for and installing updates), or uninstalling the software. The product documentation, if any, may also specify how to turn off updates for your specific device or software.\line         c. Germany and Austria.\line             Warranty. The properly licensed software will perform substantially as described in any Microsoft materials that accompany the software. However, Microsoft gives no contractual guarantee in relation to the licensed software.\line             Limitation of Liability. In case of intentional conduct, gross negligence, claims based on the Product Liability Act, as well as, in case of death or personal or physical injury, Microsoft is liable according to the statutory law.\line\line         Subject to the foregoing clause (ii), Microsoft will only be liable for slight negligence if Microsoft is in breach of such material contractual obligations, the fulfillment of which facilitate the due performance of this agreement, the breach of which would endanger the purpose of this agreement and the compliance with which a party may constantly trust in (so-called \ldblquote cardinal obligations\rdblquote ). In other cases of slight negligence, Microsoft will not be liable for slight negligence.\line     11. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. The software is licensed \ldblquote as-is.\rdblquote  You bear the risk of using it. Microsoft gives no express warranties, guarantees or conditions. To the extent permitted under your local laws, Microsoft excludes the implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement.\line\line     12. LIMITATION ON AND EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES. You can recover from Microsoft and its suppliers only direct damages up to U.S. $5.00. You cannot recover any other damages, including consequential, lost profits, special, indirect or incidental damages.\line\line     This limitation applies to (a) anything related to the software, services, content (including code) on third party Internet sites, or third party applications; and (b) claims for breach of contract, breach of warranty, guarantee or condition, strict liability, negligence, or other tort to the extent permitted by applicable law.\line\line     It also applies even if Microsoft knew or should have known about the possibility of the damages. The above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you because your state or country may not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental, consequential or other damages.\par

Limitations on Grant Scope\line\line      The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under this\line      License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the distribution\line      or licensing of Covered Software under this License. Notwithstanding Section\line      2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a Contributor:\line\line      a. for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software; or\line\line      b. for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party\rquote s\line         modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its\line         Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor\line         Version); or\line\line      c. under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of its\line         Contributions.\line\line      This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks, or\line      logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with the\line      notice requirements in Section 3.4).\line\line 2.4.

Fair Use\line\line      This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under applicable\line      copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other equivalents.\line\line 2.7. Conditions\line\line      Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted in\line      Section 2.1.\line\line\line 3. Responsibilities\line\line 3.1. Distribution of Source Form\line\line      All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any\line      Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under the\line      terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form\line      of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how\line      they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not attempt to alter or\line      restrict the recipients\rquote  rights in the Source Code Form.\line\line 3.2. Distribution of Executable Form\line\line      If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:\line\line      a. such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form,\line         as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the\line         Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by\line         reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost\line         of distribution to the recipient; and\line\line      b. You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License,\line         or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the license for\line         the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients\rquote\line         rights in the Source Code Form under this License.\line\line 3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work\line\line      You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,\line      provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for the\line      Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software\line      with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered\line      Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits\line      You to additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of\line      such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at\line      their option, further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of\line      either this License or such Secondary License(s).\line\line 3.4. Notices\line\line      You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including\line      copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations\line      of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered\line      Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the extent\line      required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.\line\line 3.5. Application of Additional Terms\line\line      You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,\line      indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered\line      Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf\line      of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such\line      warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You\line      alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any\line      liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,\line      indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional\line      disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any\line      jurisdiction.\line\line 4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation\line\line    If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License\line    with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial\line    order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License\line    to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code\line    they affect. Such description must be placed in a text file included with all\line    distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to the\line    extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be\line    sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to\line    understand it.\line\line 5. Termination\line\line 5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You\line      fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant,\line      then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor\line      are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor\line      explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis,\line      if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some\line      reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into compliance.\line      Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an\line      ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by\line      some reasonable means, this is the first time You have received notice of\line      non-compliance with this License from such Contributor, and You become\line      compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt of the notice.\line\line 5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent\line      infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims,\line      and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or\line      indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and\line      all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License\line      shall terminate.\line\line 5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user\line      license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been\line      validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to\line      termination shall survive termination.\line\line 6. Disclaimer of Warranty\line\line    Covered Software is provided under this License on an \ldblquote as is\rdblquote  basis, without\line    warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including,\line    without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects,\line    merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire\line    risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You.\line    Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any\line    Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or\line    correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this\line    License. No use of  any Covered Software is authorized under this License\line    except under this disclaimer.\line\line 7. Limitation of Liability\line\line    Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including\line    negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who\line    distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any\line    direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any\line    character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of\line    goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\line    other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been\line    informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability\line    shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such\line    party\rquote s negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation.\line    Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or\line    consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.\line\line 8. Litigation\line\line    Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of\line    a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business\line    and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without\line    reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall\line    prevent a party\rquote s ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.\line\line 9. Miscellaneous\line\line    This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter\line    hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such\line    provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it\line    enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a\line    contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe\line    this License against a Contributor.\line\line\line 10. Versions of the License\line\line 10.1. New Versions\line\line       Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section\line       10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or\line       publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a\line       distinguishing version number.\line\line 10.2. Effect of New Versions\line\line       You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version of\line       the License under which You originally received the Covered Software, or\line       under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license\line       steward.\line\line 10.3. Modified Versions\line\line       If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to\line       create a new license for such software, you may create and use a modified\line       version of this License if you rename the license and remove any\line       references to the name of the license steward (except to note that such\line       modified license differs from this License).\line\line 10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary Licenses\line       If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With\line       Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the\line       notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.\line\line Exhibit A - Source Code Form License Notice\line\line       This Source Code Form is subject to the\line       terms of the Mozilla Public License, v.\line       2.0.
